# XMLFields was created to answer an interview question I had but with mega complicated but very processor efficient using C++ templates. My plan is to explain my whole code here to help other understand templates.
The question was, please write code that could take XML (like) data (JSON) and transform it to classes. Start with the classes.
Oh, and by the way, that was not the correct answer to the question. I reallized that when the interviewer's eyes spaced out and looked like I did not know what I was doing because he/she wanted a simple OOP class with simple puplic accessor, and obviously did not understand the subject of templates for C++.
